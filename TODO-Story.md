What happens in the rooftop:
    
    You can make the sky dark or beautiful
    
    There are some vents that you can enter and explore late in the game as one of the last things
        The vents are really dark, so to explore you either need a lot of light or you need to be able to feel comfortable / befriended the darkness
        

What happens in the forest:
    
    The forest is the dream of a child hidding from a monster. You can make the monster kill the child or make the child feel safe. 
        It depends on your level of darkness how easy or hard it will be.
        
        There should be timed events
