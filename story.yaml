#############
# FOR DEVELOPERS ONLY
# 
# There are 2 types of structures: TEXT and WORDS
# WORDS are clickable.
# TEXT contain words.
#
# FLAGS:
# When you click on a WORD, it might set a flag, that can be used for conditionals.
# For convenience, the keyword of the text substitution is automatically added as a flag 
# whose value increase by 1 for every turn the text is present. It is removes as soon as the text is not displayed any longer.
#
# TEXT-KEYWORDS:
# You have access to the keywords of the texts that are being displayed, which can be used to modify the behavior of the WORDS.
# 
# OBS:
# The code make use of the id of the words, in such a way that if there is more than one of the same word on the screen, only one of them will be accessed.
#
# Timed Events: have a time and an array "e", which has the same syntax as the actions.
# ce is what checks if the timed event should keep existing after something happen 
# ce = condition end
